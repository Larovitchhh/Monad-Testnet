# Monad-Testnet
Monad Testnet
Overview
Monad is an innovative Layer 1 blockchain that aims to improve throughput and efficiency while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) standards. This repository serves as a hub for experimenting with the Monad Testnet, including smart contract deployment, node setup, and transaction testing.
Features
Smart Contract Examples: Sample contracts to deploy on the Monad Testnet.
Node Configuration: Guides and scripts for setting up a Monad Testnet node.
Testnet Faucet Integration: Tools to request test tokens for development.
Documentation: Comprehensive guides for interacting with the Monad Testnet.
